my humble .emacs file. Contains also contents of .emacs.d directory.

I have tried to use git submodules as much as I could for the packages I use; otherwise
I added whole packages for easier re-deployment on different machines.

After cloning the repository, submodules' directories are empty. To get the actual files,
do the following (from the repo's top directory):

 > git submodule init

 > git submodule update


Contains also utility script 'setup-dotfiles' that will add links in home directory so
that the configuration files are ready to use.
